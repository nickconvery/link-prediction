# link-prediction

## Introduction
In this project we assess the extent to which collaborations between hip hop artists can be predicted using a supervised learning algorithm trained on a dataset of graph features (e.g. common neighbours). Our motivation is that a sufficiently ‘good’ supervised learning algorithm could in principle be used by an artist to proactively identify others with whom they are likely to collaborate in the future and thereby accelerate the collaborative process. 

## Data
All data used in this project was scraped from the community-built music database [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com) using the [Official Python Client](https://github.com/discogs/discogs_client) for the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/).
